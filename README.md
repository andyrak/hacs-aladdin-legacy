## :warning::rotating_light::construction: WORK IN PROGRESS :construction::rotating_light::warning:

## Summary
[Genie Aladdin Connect](https://www.geniecompany.com/aladdin-connect-by-genie) legacy plugin for Home Assistant via HACS.

A workaround to use the legacy mechanisms while Aladdin works on their new API.

## Install

### HACS Installation
- Go to HACS -> Integrations
- Click the three dots on the top right and select Custom Repositories
- Enter https://github.com/andyrak/hacs-aladdin-legacy.git as repository, select the category Integration and click Add
- A new custom integration shows up for installation (Aladdin Connect Legacy) - install it
- Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation
Copy the contents of the `custom_components` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components`
folder and restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration
Configuration is managed entirely from the UI via `config_flow`.
Simply go to Settings -> Devices & services -> Add Integration and search for "Aladdin Connect Legacy"
in the search box.

## Notes
After installing, you will get the core Aladdin Connect integration deprecation warning; this can safely be ignored.

## Debugging
To aquire debug-logs, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.aladdin_connect: debug
```

Logs should now be available in `home-assistant.log`.
